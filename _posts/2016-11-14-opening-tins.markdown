Reading the post-election reaction of the coastal _intelligenstia_, I'm reminded of something Orwell wrote in "The Lion and the Unicorn:"

> Since the fifties every war in which England has engaged has started off with a series of disasters, after which the situation has been saved by people comparatively low in the social scale. The higher commanders, drawn from the aristocracy, could never prepare for modern war, because in order to do so they would have had to admit to themselves that the world was changing. **They have always clung to obsolete methods and weapons, because they inevitably saw each war as a repetition of the last. Before the Boer War they prepared for the Zulu War, before the 1914 for the Boer War, and before the present war for 1914.** Even at this moment hundreds of thousands of men in England are being trained with the bayonet, a weapon entirely useless except for opening tins.

Of course those who cannot remember the past are doomed to repeat it. What Orwell is pointing out is that many who do remember are doomed as well.
